# VelocityBroadcast
VelocityBroadcast is a plugin that can send broadcast messages to the entire proxy network. This plugin supports an infinite amount of servers on a network and has an easy to read text format so users can read it as easily as possible.

## Information
This plugin is currently in the latest stable build and works as intended. If any bugs arise, please do not hesitate to let me know on discord. My username is adzelfirestar

## Commands
I have updated the command structure a bit. No longer will /vbroadcast or /velocitybroadcast work, as those are too cumbersom for some people. Instead the command is /vb. The new command structure is as follows:
- /vb {message} | Sends a message across the proxy for all backend servers to see
- /vb prefix {New Prefix} | You can change the prefix that players and staff see when a message is sent in chat
- /vb checkupdates | If there is an update available, it will call that update and let you know
- /vb reload | Reloads the configuration to update the config file without restarting the proxy

## Future plans
Right now we only have two plans. You can suggest more though if you want to see a feature added. Just add a suggestion through the "Issues" menu above. I will take a look and see if it is a good idea to add the feature you want to see.

## Licensing
Please do not distribute my code as your own. Please do not rip my code and make a new plugin and claim it as your own. Please do not distribute my plugin jar or other files elsewhere. They are on github for a reason. If you want to suggest commits and help me make this plugin better, do so through the correct channels. Thank you.
